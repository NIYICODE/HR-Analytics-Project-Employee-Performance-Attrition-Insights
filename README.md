# **HR Analytics Dashboard: Employee Performance & Attrition Insights**

## **Project Overview**
Managing workforce performance, engagement, and retention is critical for organizational success. This project transforms raw HR and employee data into a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard**, providing insights into performance scores, training outcomes, attrition trends, and demographic distributions. The dashboard equips HR leaders with actionable intelligence to optimize workforce planning, engagement strategies, and training investments.


## **Purpose**
**Primary Goal:** Analyze employee performance, attrition, and training outcomes to identify trends, high-risk groups, and opportunities for operational improvements.  

**Secondary Goal:** Enable HR leadership to make data-driven decisions regarding training, performance management, and retention strategies.



## **Technical Stack**
- **Microsoft Excel:** Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting, Formulas  
- **Power Query:** Data cleaning, merging, and transformation  
- **Excel Formulas:** SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIFS, VLOOKUP/INDEX-MATCH  
- **Visualization Techniques:** Bar charts, pie charts, line charts, KPI cards, slicers  
- **Analytical Techniques:** Trend analysis, correlation, What-If analysis, segmentation



## **Data Source**
The dashboard integrates multiple HR datasets:
- Employee demographics (Age, Gender, Marital Status, Department, Job Role)  
- Compensation and benefits (Monthly Income, Salary Hikes)  
- Performance scores (Exceeds, Fully Meets, Needs Improvement, PIP)  
- Training data (Cost, Completion, Outcome)  
- Termination and attrition records  
- Department, team, and role-level hierarchies  



## **Analytical Narrative & Key Questions**

### **Business Problem**
HR teams often struggle to correlate performance, training, and attrition metrics across a large workforce. Without a unified view, decisions regarding retention, engagement, and training investments are reactive rather than proactive.

### **Analytical Questions**
1. Which departments and teams have the highest/lowest performance scores?  
2. How is employee attrition trending over time?  
3. What is the distribution of employees across job levels, departments, and gender?  
4. How are training costs and outcomes distributed across programs and employee demographics?  
5. Which factors (department, performance score, age, tenure) correlate with attrition or engagement?  
6. How can HR identify high-risk groups and areas for strategic intervention?  



## **Data Preparation & Modeling**
- **Data Cleaning:** Used Excel and Power Query to remove inconsistencies, fix missing values (e.g., Department, Gender), and standardize data formats.  
- **Table Merging:** Consolidated multiple datasets (Employee Info, Performance, Training, Terminations) for integrated analysis.  
- **Metrics Engineering:**  
  - Average tenure per manager  
  - Total and average monthly income per department  
  - Rolling averages and performance distributions  
- **Conditional Formatting:** Highlighted high-income employees, performance outliers, and training completion gaps.  
- **Pivot Tables:** Summarized employee counts, average income, training outcomes, and attrition by department, gender, and job role.  



## **Dashboard Insights**


### **A. Workforce Overview**
- Total employees: 3,000  
- Active employees: 2,458 (82%)  
- Terminated employees: 387 (13%)  
- Department and gender slicers allow dynamic filtering.

### **B. Performance Analysis**
- Performance distribution shows employees across **Exceeds, Fully Meets, Needs Improvement, and PIP**.  
- Department and job-level comparisons highlight areas of high and low performance.

- ### **C. Training Analysis**
- Total training cost per program ranges from ~320K to 365K.  
- Training outcomes are tracked by gender and program, revealing completion rates and gaps.  


### **D. Attrition Trends**
- Line chart of exit dates shows a gradual increase in voluntary and involuntary terminations over 2018–2023.  
- Total terminations segmented by gender reveal actionable patterns for retention strategy.  


### **E. Department & Demographics Insights**
- Total employees by job division highlight team size differences (Field Operations: 789, General-Con: 509, Engineers: 275, etc.)  
- Gender distribution, employment type (Full-time, Part-time, Contract), and engagement scores provide granular insights for workforce planning.


## **Business Impact & Insights**

| Focus Area | Decision Insight |
|------------|----------------|
| **Performance Management** | Identify departments needing coaching or performance interventions |
| **Training ROI** | Allocate training budgets based on program outcomes and completion gaps |
